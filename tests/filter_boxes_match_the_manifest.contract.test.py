"""Every filter box this module paints is a filter the manifest actually concedes (hub#1182).

THE SYMPTOM. A column is declared `filterable`, the table draws its funnel, the person opens it and
types — and nothing happens. No error, no empty state, no «that filter did nothing»: the same rows
as before. The runtime is doing what it was told: `run_list` only sends the `f_<col>` parameters the
manifest declares under `list.filters`, and drops the rest on the floor. So a box the component
paints over a column nobody declared is a control that cannot work, and looks exactly like one that
found no matches.

WHAT hub#1182 IMPUTED TO THIS MODULE, and what was really here. The sweep flagged
`tables.sessions.list.zone` as an undeclared filter. It is a FALSE POSITIVE: the screen REMAPS —
the column paints `zone` and the filter it writes is `zone_id`, which is declared. What was missing
is the thing that keeps it correct: a remap is one line in `onFilterChange`, and the day someone
renames it or adds a filterable column, the funnel goes back to doing nothing and no test says a
word.

Reading every table under that rule found a box that DOES lie today:

  * `tables.sessions.list` — `table_number` is painted as free text and filtered with `op: "eq"`:
    on a floor with tables `12`, `120` and `121`, typing `12` answered only the first, and on a
    hub whose tables are named (`Terraza 1`) typing a fragment emptied the list. A text box invites
    a fragment; `eq` only ever answers the value typed whole.

A picker would be the better control — the floor IS a closed set, and this very screen already
picks the zone and the waiter that way. It is NOT done here: the options would come from
`tables.tables.list`, which needs `tables.view_table`, a permission the person reading the checks
(`tables.view_tablesession`) need not have. A picker that degrades to a text box when its options
cannot be loaded is the half-dead funnel again, wearing a different hat (that exact trap is open as
ERPlora/sales#260). The control stays a text box, and the manifest is made to serve it.

## The rules, and why each one

| The box says | The manifest must say | Because |
|---|---|---|
| `filterType: 'text'` | `op: 'like'` | a free-text box invites a fragment; `eq` empties the list unless the user types the value whole |
| `filterType: 'select'` | `op: 'eq'` | a closed domain is CHOSEN, and the value chosen is exact — `like` would silently match one value inside another |
| `filterType: 'range'` / `'daterange'` | `op: 'range'` | two bounds need the operator that takes two bounds |
| `filterable: true` | the column IS in `list.filters` | otherwise the runtime drops the `f_<col>` parameter and the box does nothing (hub#1182) |
| `sortable: true` | the column IS in `list.sort` | the sort whitelist is a SECOND door: a header outside it does not sort, silently |

EVERY `filterType` a column can take is checked, not the first one written. A column may pick its
control at render time (`...(this.payMethods.length ? { filterType: 'select' } : { filterType:
'text' })`), and one `op` cannot serve both — `select` needs `eq`, `text` needs `like`. A gate that
reads only the first branch blesses the manifest for the path the user is NOT on, which is exactly
where the half-dead funnel hides. If a column can be two controls, it has to be honest as both, or
be filterable only when it is the one that works.

  No Postgres, no Docker: it reads the manifest and the Web Components.
